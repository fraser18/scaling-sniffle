// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

const scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
const width = 1024;
const height = 768;
const color = light; // ZIM colors like green, blue, pink, faint, clear, etc.
const outerColor = dark; // any HTML colors like "violet", "#333", etc. are fine to use

const frame = new Frame(scaling, width, height, color, outerColor);
frame.on("ready", () => { // ES6 Arrow Function - like function(){}
    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

    const stage = frame.stage;
    let stageW = frame.width;
    let stageH = frame.height;

    
    new Circle(100, pink)
        .center()
        .drag();



    stage.update(); // this is needed to show any changes

}); // end of ready
